"There is a large number of strong mathematicians (and other natural "
"scientists) of russian origin. This is no coincidence. What is not widely"
" known is that most (if not all) of them come from a relatively small "
"interconnected community. During the second half of 20th century a "
"specific methodology for teaching math was developed in Russia. I don’t "
"have exact numbers, but I think I wouldn’t be far off, if I say that "
"about a half of famous russian mathematicians come from the same small "
"set of High Schools including about four in Moscow and two in St. "
"Petersburg (see Chapter 5, Section 2, p.191, par. 2-3, in the book <a "
"href='http://goo.gl/T2hyDs'> 'Russian Mathematics education. History and "
"world significance.'</a>)"

"The student gets a <i>sheet</i>, say called “X theory”, in which "
"definitions of “X object” and “Y property” are given with a set of "
"problems. Solving the problems the student builds the whole X theory by "
"themselves. Some of the problems ask to prove a theorem, or ask if a "
"statement is true. Some are for practice, they build skills and methods "
"relevant to X theory. Average time to solve a sheet - about 2 weeks."

"As the pupils would solve problems and work their way through sheets, "
"they would tell their solutions to one of the team teaching the class. "
"The teacher would listen to the pupil, would ask him questions like "
"'okay, but what if this is not true?', 'what if that case is present?', "
"basically, the pupil is defending his solutions and the teacher is an "
"opponent. However, there is a rule, that all the solutions must be "
"completely and correctly written down. The teacher should be provided "
"with a complete, correct solution given he doesn't ask for any oral "
"report. Usually a team consists of the head teacher (an active or ex-"
"active mathematician) and a number of math undergrads. These undergrads "
"are most often alumni of the same school and the same teacher, they used "
"to be pupils just a couple of years ago. This way a continuity emerges. A"
" re-accuring phenomenon is the pupil and undergrad developing a lasting "
"bond, that of student and teacher. Later, pupil becomes an undergrad, "
"undergrad goes to graduate school and may soon take a class as a head "
"teacher himself. This system works very well. It actually works without "
"any incentives (the wages for all involved are vanishing with exception "
"for the head teacher, but he is usually doing this because he wants, not "
"because of the money. It is usually such a person that the nominal wage "
"they recieve is nothing compared to what they could earn), there is "
"always enough alumni wishing to work as teachers for some time, to give "
"back. I'm providing this description as empirical evidence that there's "
"always enough people wishing to give back to accommodate a new class."
