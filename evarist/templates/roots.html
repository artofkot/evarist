        There is a large number of strong mathematicians (and other natural scientists) of russian origin. This is no coincidence. What is not widely known is that most (if not all) of them come from a relatively small interconnected community. During the second half of 20th century a specific methodology for teaching math was developed in Russia. I don’t have exact numbers, but I think I wouldn’t be far off, if I say that about a half of famous russian mathematicians come from the same small set of High Schools including about four in Moscow and two in St. Petersburg (see Chapter 5, Section 2, p.191, par. 2-3, in the book <a href='http://goo.gl/T2hyDs'> 'Russian Mathematics education. History and world significance.'</a>)

        Our idea is to take the techniques of USSR special mathematical schools online and make them accessible to the whole globe.

        Here is the description of said methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
        a) <i>Everything-in-problems</i> approach.
        <br>
        The student gets a <i>sheet</i>, say called “X theory”, in which definitions of “X object” and “Y property” are given with a set of problems. Solving the problems the student builds the whole X theory by themselves. Some of the problems ask to prove a theorem, or ask if a statement is true. Some are for practice, they build skills and methods relevant to X theory. Average time to solve a sheet - about 2 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) <i>Undergraduate students review solutions.</i>
        <br>
        As the pupils would solve problems and work their way through sheets, they would tell their solutions to one of the team teaching the class. The teacher would listen to the pupil, would ask him questions like 'okay, but what if this is not true?', 'what if that case is present?', basically, the pupil is defending his solutions and the teacher is an opponent. However, there is a rule, that all the solutions must be completely and correctly written down. The teacher should be provided with a complete, correct solution given he doesn't ask for any oral report. Usually a team consists of the head teacher (an active or ex-active mathematician) and a number of math undergrads. These undergrads are most often alumni of the same school and the same teacher, they used to be pupils just a couple of years ago. This way a continuity emerges. A re-accuring phenomenon is the pupil and undergrad developing a lasting bond, that of student and teacher. Later, pupil becomes an undergrad, undergrad goes to graduate school and may soon take a class as a head teacher himself. This system works very well. It actually works without any incentives (the wages for all involved are vanishing with exception for the head teacher, but he is usually doing this because he wants, not because of the money. It is usually such a person that the nominal wage they recieve is nothing compared to what they could earn), there is always enough alumni wishing to work as teachers for some time, to give back. I'm providing this description as empirical evidence that there's always enough people wishing to give back to accommodate a new class.
