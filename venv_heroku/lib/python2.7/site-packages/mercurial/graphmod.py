    ### Quick summary of the algorithm
    #
    # This function is based around a "retention" principle. We keep revisions
    # in memory until we are ready to emit a whole branch that immediately
    # "merges" into an existing one. This reduces the number of parallel
    # branches with interleaved revisions.
    #
    # During iteration revs are split into two groups:
    # A) revision already emitted
    # B) revision in "retention". They are stored as different subgroups.
    #
    # for each REV, we do the following logic:
    #
    #   1) if REV is a parent of (A), we will emit it. If there is a
    #   retention group ((B) above) that is blocked on REV being
    #   available, we emit all the revisions out of that retention
    #   group first.
    #
    #   2) else, we'll search for a subgroup in (B) awaiting for REV to be
    #   available, if such subgroup exist, we add REV to it and the subgroup is
    #   now awaiting for REV.parents() to be available.
    #
    #   3) finally if no such group existed in (B), we create a new subgroup.
    #
    #
    # To bootstrap the algorithm, we emit the tipmost revision (which
    # puts it in group (A) from above).

    revs.sort(reverse=True)

    # Set of parents of revision that have been emitted. They can be considered
    # unblocked as the graph generator is already aware of them so there is no
    # need to delay the revisions that reference them.
    #
    # If someone wants to prioritize a branch over the others, pre-filling this
    # set will force all other branches to wait until this branch is ready to be
    # emitted.
    unblocked = set(firstbranch)

    # list of groups waiting to be displayed, each group is defined by:
    #
    #   (revs:    lists of revs waiting to be displayed,
    #    blocked: set of that cannot be displayed before those in 'revs')
    #
    # The second value ('blocked') correspond to parents of any revision in the
    # group ('revs') that is not itself contained in the group. The main idea
    # of this algorithm is to delay as much as possible the emission of any
    # revision.  This means waiting for the moment we are about to display
    # these parents to display the revs in a group.
    #
    # This first implementation is smart until it encounters a merge: it will
    # emit revs as soon as any parent is about to be emitted and can grow an
    # arbitrary number of revs in 'blocked'. In practice this mean we properly
    # retains new branches but gives up on any special ordering for ancestors
    # of merges. The implementation can be improved to handle this better.
    #
    # The first subgroup is special. It corresponds to all the revision that
    # were already emitted. The 'revs' lists is expected to be empty and the
    # 'blocked' set contains the parents revisions of already emitted revision.

    # changesets to select what the first emitted branch should be.
