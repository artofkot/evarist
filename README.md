=======

Welcome to the source repository of [evarist](http://www.evarist.org/), 
website for studying math through problem solving.
Read our [first blogpost](http://www.evarist.org/blog#first_blogpost) about how everything works, and here is the detailed [explanation](http://www.evarist.org/about) of our methodology.

### For contributors.

1. We are looking for people to start off the community! If you want to help us and you know math enough so that you can check solutions on our website - that is great. Just register on [evarist.org](http://www.evarist.org/) and email us, we will make you a checker, and you will be able to check solutions, and thus help students learn math.
2. You also can help us with translation of problem sets from russian to english. Email us in this case, please.
3. [Issue tracker](https://github.com/artofkot/evarist/issues) is our todo list for code. Just fork, work on an issue, and then pull-request us ([docs on the process](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)). Email me (artofkot@gmail.com), and I will give you the keys for the app, if needed.
